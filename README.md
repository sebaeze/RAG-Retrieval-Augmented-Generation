# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repo is intended to teach about RAG technology

## What is RAG?

RAG is a technique that integrates the AI Model with external data in order to enhance the result without the need to re-train the model.
The process consist of retrieving data from an external store, such as a vector database, to include in the prompt or context to be processed by the AI Model.

Retrieval:  Fetch data from external knowledge base.
Augmented:  Includes the data previously fetched into the query/prompt.
Generation: 

## How Does It work?

## Benefits:

- Enhance knowledge data of a AI pipeline, generating responses more acurate.
- Up-to-date data.
- 

## Vector Database
